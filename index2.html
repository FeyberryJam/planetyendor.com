            <h1>What is Planet Yendor?</h1>
            <p>Well, originally it was a Metroidvania game with a SNES feeling look and feel.  I still hope
            to make that game someday!  I bought this website to blog about my thoughts and development
            process but not much came of it.  I then thought I'd just turn planetyendor.com into a review 
            site that I used as a platform to babble about how much I loved the Metroidvania genre and
            procedural level creation and things like that.  Currently however the website is primarily used
            for writing down a few of my thoughts on Yendor: Prelude that don't fit in Twitter's stringent
            character limit!</p>
