                <h1>What is Planet Yendor?</h1>
                <p>Well, originally it was a Metroidvania game with a SNES era look and feel.  I still hope
                to make that game someday!  I bought this website to blog about my thoughts and development
                process but not much came of it.  I then thought I'd just turn planetyendor.com into a review 
                site that I used as a platform to babble about how much I loved the Metroidvania genre and
                procedural level creation and things like that.  Currently however the website is primarily used
                for writing down a few of my thoughts on Yendor: Prelude that don't fit within Twitter's stringent
                character limit!</p>
            </div>
            <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="b">
                <h1>Okay then, so what is Yendor: Prelude?</h1>
                <p>Yendor: Prelude is my current project!  It's what I started working on after I messed with
                Minecraft modding for a year and randomly got excited about working on a Metroidvania title again.
                I'll try to create a page dedicated to it "soon" (read: not soon) but in the mean time you can
                try tossing a question at my <a href="https://twitter.com/FeyberryJam">twitter account</a> and 
                I might get back to you there!</p>

            <div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="b">
                <h1>This website is... off putting</h1>
                <p>No... <i>noooo</i> it's not that bad, is it?  I haven't made a website in years and while
                learning about html5 I bumped into <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jquery mobile</a> which
                seems to do a lot of cool things quickly.  I plan on testing the site on several different browsers
                on my pc before 100% committing to it.  So far it looks okay to me, hopefully it's looks sort of 
                nice on your system too.</p>
